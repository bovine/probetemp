This is a set of several utilities that allow you to record and graph
temperatures from a Dallas DS18S20 compatible sensor over an RS232
serial port.  The utilities are:

* readtemp.pl -- diagnostic utility to test sensor readability
* probetemp.pl -- capture temperature readings to a TXT logfile and an RRD file
* gengraphs.sh -- generate PNG graphs from the RRD file
* runbacklog.pl -- rebuild a corrupted RRD file from the TXT logfile

You will need the following prerequisites:

* Perl
* RRDtool
